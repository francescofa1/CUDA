# CUDA
This project compares the performance of sequential vs. parallel (CUDA + Thrust) approaches in counting purple pixels in an image. By leveraging GPU parallel processing, we demonstrate a significant speedup over traditional CPU-based methods. Results highlight the efficiency of CUDA in accelerating image processing tasks.
